# i3configs
This repo is deigned to cut a lot of the labor out. It should do everything from setting up the wallpaper to deploying all the configs for Xserver and i3

It was created for a Fedora on Thinkpad laptop with C++ coding and general STEM work in mind but should do for all kinds of purposes.

This is still very much a work in progress thing and was made for my convenience when deploying a new OS.

The only thing i would have in mind is the timezone in i3status-small.conf is set to Warsaw.

The OS is stable and it doesnt look half bad IMO

All you need to do is clone the repo to the home directory, give the setup.sh permits to execute with /sudo chmod +x setup.sh and execute the file with sudo privilages.
