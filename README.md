# i3configs
This repo is deigned to cut a lot of the labor out. It should do everything from setting up the wallpaper to deploying all the configs for Xserver and i3

It was created for a Fedora on Thinkpad laptop with c++ coding and general STEM work in mind but should do for all kinds of purposes.

This is still very much a work in progress thing and was made for my convenience when deploying a new OS.
